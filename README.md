# UX Design

## Design Process and Early Prototyping and ideation

### 1. Design Process

In the early stage, through the joint participation of team members, the product experience brought to users by this product decision is decided together. Gathering consensus in the early group meetings, deciding the main product features at a higher level and meeting expectations, reducing repeated revisions of the main keynote in the future and saving communication costs. The Mood Board is used to summarize the personality of the product and extract the dominant tone of the project on the UI. Communicate the personality of the product in subsequent communication with users. Paper Prototype sees the whole picture of the product in the simplest and least technical way possible. Draw quickly and clearly in a team meeting to discuss iterations of the product. Good ideas, reserved; Bad ones, just throw them in the wastebasket.

A good product is about users, so the medium term work of UX is about users.

Firstly, the main user groups of the accounting tools were identified through data retrieval methods. Again through the [Persona](https://mortoray.com/2019/03/28/a-programmers-introduction-to-user-portraits/#:~:text=User%20portraits%2C%20or%20personas%2C%20are,the%20people%20using%20our%20product.) method to specify who the target user is, outline the target user, contact user demands and confirm the design direction. The user role formed by user portrait is representative and can represent the main audience and target group of the product.

Finally, according to the preliminary investigation and results, the final version was determined by discussing with the front-end engineers. Of course, our team will not be dissolved because of this. The interaction designer has made another excellent version to improve the game performance, interface design and layout rationality in all aspects as a future improvement plan.



### 2. Mood Board

Before the UX design, the five members of the team held an online Brainstorming meeting, which was set for 30 minutes. The goal was to identify a set of key words that could describe the product of the team's project and prepare the mood board for later creation.

The moderator and recorder and moderator of the meeting will be the UX designer.

In the first five minutes of the meeting, the four members, except the host, independently found out 10 key words that could describe the group project products in their minds.

Next, the moderator will cross out a relatively unimportant key word five times at a time, so that each person is left with five key words. Then, everyone sends their keywords to the host, and the host scrambles the keywords. At this time, the host has 20 keywords in his hand.

In the next part, the moderator will show the key words to everyone in turn and hold a vote. If a keyword is voted by all members, it is reserved directly. Key words that did not receive a total number of votes can be elaborated by the proposer to get a second chance to vote. The second ballot may be retained if it receives all the votes of members.

After the first few rounds of development, a total of seven product keywords were selected, respectively: simple, fashionable, efficient, interesting, special, accurate, easy to operate.

Collecting images from the UX designer to make the [Mood Board](http://www.gomoodboard.com/boards/8vjeBuU9/share), the pictures of the products accord with through Brainstorming meetings to discuss key words.

### 3. Paper Prototyping

After the discussion in the group meeting, the product is initially planned to have the following three pages, namely functions:

- An account page

  ![](https://github.com/ligangchn/UX-Design-of-Group-Project/blob/main/images/WeChat5f1b6a50bfea93bca3057487bdb35b9f.png)

  This page is the main page of our accounting products, that is, the user enters the page directly after boarding the page. The page has three sections:
  
  a. The first board is like a calculator, where users can input the amount to show their single expenditure or income.
  b. The second block is the Note function. When the user enters the amount, he may make some notes to remind himself or just record it.
  c. The third block is the TAGE function. The user must select the type of the record when entering the amount. This type can be food, clothing and other properties provided by the system, users can also manually add their own desired tags.
  d. The fourth section is to select whether the amount belongs to EXPEND or INCOME. This can also be used to calculate the total amount of users at a later stage (it is not shown in the manuscript, but it is very important).

- A statistic page

  ![](https://github.com/ligangchn/UX-Design-of-Group-Project/blob/main/images/WeChat7424a1137d2bc611f8727663c93ad1c1.png)

  This page is responsible for displaying the record that the user has entered. Expend and INCOME are recorded and counted separately. Users can modify records in this page, such as label change, amount modification, remarks modification, deletion of records, etc.
  ![WechatIMG35](https://github.com/ligangchn/UX-Design-of-Group-Project/blob/main/images/WechatIMG35.jpeg)

- A tag page

  ![tage Page flow](https://github.com/ligangchn/UX-Design-of-Group-Project/blob/main/images/WeChat02392af1a4d203697ff0117fa06a8c87.png)

  This page supports the user to add or delete tags, but cannot delete the original tags provided by the system. When the user deletes the used tag (for example, the user wants to delete the [Game]tag, but the [Game]tag is already used), the system will pop up a second confirmation box to confirm the user's action.

## Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders

### 1. Interacting users

With the rapid development of economy and science and technology, people have more and more purchasing power, and more and more consumption objects and methods. As a result, people have less and less feeling about "spending money". A little APP, a quick scan of the QR code, and the transaction is completed. At the end of the month, people often look at their credit card bills and paycard balances and wonder, where has all my money gone? Therefore, accounting has gradually become a necessary part of people's lives, therefore, accounting products emerged at the historic moment.

According to [Analysis of competitive products in accounting and financial APP: Why can you dominate?](http://www.woshipm.com/evaluating/810827.html) to the user scene, customer pain points, user requirements, according to the analysis of the accounting program aimed at spending more, not take written paper pen to an account; Trying to control excessive spending; You have a hobby and you want to visualize the cost of that hobby.

According to competing goods [analysis accounting software](https://www.jianshu.com/p/a7b9d8e07946) for accounting software, to use the books of women accounted for most of the market, from age 24 and 35 user accounts for baby. Among them, users aged between 31 and 35 accounted for 40 percent, and most of the users of such products are from the super first-tier cities or first-tier cities.

To sum up, our target group is urban people aged 24-35, and the details are presented in [Understanding of user group](#Understanding of user group).



### 2. Broader stakeholders

- The project team

  The project team is a direct stakeholder with all the advertising revenue and additional products in the later stage.

- Users: Students, Working personnel, housewife

  User groups such as students and people with limited funds can reasonably plan their spending through this accounting program; With a certain capital base, professionals and housewives can use the software to allocate their funds rationally (the software will have financial management functions in the later stage).

- Investment and financial management institutions

  With the development of Internet finance and the gradual improvement of people's financial awareness, bookkeeping software represented by note-taking and digging money, with tool link services, drives low-frequency financial management by high-frequency bookkeeping, has become a very important flow entrance of personal finance and finance. After that, the financial recommendation section, combined with practical operation, regularly recommends safe, secure and profitable financial products for users. Or the financial page should set up an intelligent recommendation module to recommend users according to their behavior data and risk tolerance. Investment and financial management institutions can recommend their products through the software, and also become a wide range of beneficiaries.

  

## UX approach

### 1. Brainstorming

This method mainly consists of value engineering working group members discussing and discussing in the form of meeting in a normal harmonious and unrestricted atmosphere, breaking conventions, thinking positively, speaking freely and fully expressing their views. This approach is used in UX design to establish the initial product style. Gathering consensus in the early group meetings, deciding the main product features at a higher level and meeting expectations, reducing repeated revisions of the main keynote in the future and saving communication costs.



### 2. Data information retrieval

User groups and broad stakeholders are preliminarily determined through literature retrieval of user data, and UI and UX are designed according to the data in the later stage to better conform the program to the habits and preferences of user groups.



### 3. User interviews (open-ended questions)

To study users, it is necessary to understand their inner needs through their language and behavior, eliminate fake needs and screen real needs, that is, to see the essence through the phenomenon and dig out the core demands of users. Open-ended questions keep the conversation going and give it some depth and interest.

In this project, the user interview is used to determine the target users and understand the users, so that the product really meets the market demand.



## Understanding of user group

### 1. Initial open user questions

User portrait is the virtual representative of real users. First of all, it is based on the real, based on the situational interview of real users. In order to identify the target group, the interaction designer asked five people who might use the bookkeeping software to conduct user interviews. The user interview used a series of open-ended questions:

1. What do you know about efficiency classes?

2. Do you have an overall plan for your spending?

3. What do you know about financial management?

4. What do you think of the bookkeeping procedures in the market?

5. What functions do you want the billing program to have?

   

### 2. Results of interview

- Target Group 1: Student Party

  - Gender: Male

  - Age: 21

  - Occupation: Student

  - Status: Just entered college

  - *What do you know about efficiency classes?*

    I don't know much about it. Do I count the Word and Excel I usually use? There are very few others.

  - *Do you have an overall plan for your spending?*

    Yes, my pocket money is given by my parents every month. It's not very much. Therefore, I need to calculate the use of money, it is easy to run out of money.

  - *What do you know about financial management?*

    I don't know much about fund stocks and so on, but I really hope that there can be a channel to help me understand them. Now I am in a state where I don't know what to do.

  - *What do you think of the billing procedures in the market?*

    I haven't used one myself, but I'll probably download one because I think it's convenient.

  - *What functions do you want the billing program to have?*

    It is good to have basic functions, such as income and expenditure records, not too complicated, want to be concise.

  

- Target group 2: office workers

  - Gender: Male

  - Age: 25

  - Occupation: Internet operation

  - status: workplace white

  - *What do you know about efficiency classes?*

    Work will use some cloud documents for operation, so timely backup, and multi-terminal operation is very convenient. There will also be productivity apps like calendars and reminders.

  - *Do you have an overall plan for your spending?*

    Yes, every month I have to use part of the money in the rent, part of the parents sent, the rest of food and clothing to do a good plan.

  - *What do you know about financial management?*

    Managing money is very important, so I will invest in funds.

  - *What do you think of the billing procedures in the market?*

    Very good, let us spend money more wisely, can reduce unnecessary expenditure to some extent.

  - *What functions do you want the billing program to have?*

    I hope the statistical function can be more powerful, so that I can see the trend of my income and expenditure reasonably. In addition, I think it is also interesting to see my income and expenditure situation directly in this way.



- Target group 3: resident family

  - Gender: Female

  - Age: 32

  - Occupation: Housewife

  - Status: Take care of the whole family at home

  - *What do you know about efficiency classes?*

    I use relatively simple, such as alarm clock, timing function; The calendar reminds me what to do each day; Keep little things in your memo.

  - *Do you have an overall plan for your spending?*

    Of course, I need to keep a detailed record of a family's income and expenditure. After all, I am a housewife.

  - *What do you know about financial management?*

    As the head of a family fortune, I enjoy reading books on investing. Spending wisely is important.

  - *What do you think of the billing procedures in the market?*

    I'm using it. I find it very convenient.

  - *What functions do you want the billing program to have?*

    Don't make it too complicated. It's better to be easy to learn. The ability to quickly look up spending or income for a given day.

  

It can be seen from the interview records that most people have had contact with efficiency programs, so they are not unfamiliar with the use of accounting programs, and it is easy to promote our programs. The second question is whether they have an overall plan for their spending. Most of them have a strong demand for it. But for the deeper level of financial management, only the working people, or the hands of a certain amount of money will understand. Therefore, in the initial stage, our program will not be involved, you can develop this function after a certain user group. The accounting program in the market has a certain user group, so we need to focus on the analysis of competing products and extract the difference between our program and the program in the market. The final bookkeeping procedure function Settings related issues, and our team's original intention coincides, hope that bookkeeping procedures more instrumental, that is, without affecting the final function of the case, simplicity ranked first, at the same time with a certain operability.

### 3. Persona

Through preliminary user interviews, some portraits are made to represent the possible real user groups in a virtual way. First of all, it is based on reality. It is not a specific person. It is divided into different types according to the differences of the target's behavior and views, quickly organized together, and then extracted the newly obtained types to form a type of user portrait.
